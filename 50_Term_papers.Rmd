## Introduction to horticulture

**1. Horticultural vs. agricultural staple crop research capacity and funding - a comparison**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/)*

This term paper compares available research capacity and funding for horticultural crops and staple crop agriculture. This evaluation can focus on a particular geographic context, for which it summarizes the research landscape (universities, other institutes) and funding streams.

**2. Horticultural diversity and its regions of origin**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/)*

This paper summarizes the evidence on the diversity of horticultural crops that humanity makes use of. It also reviews the literature on the geographic (and possibly cultural) origins of this diversity.

## Temperate fruits

**3. Is it possible to successfully produce commercial yields of temperate fruit trees under tropical climatic conditions?**

*[Anton Milyaev](http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/dr.-anton-milyaev/)*

Make an extensive literature study to find out the main constraints for temperate tree production in the tropics. Would everlasting tropical summer allow generating two yields each year? What fundamental orchard management practices would need to be completely re-thought and adjusted for the new climatic zone? Are there any examples of successful temperate fruit tree management in the tropics? In your term paper, you will provide evidence as well as pros and cons based on the biological and physiological aspects known for temperate fruit trees.

**4. Pesticide-free plant protection of temperate fruit trees based on beneficial (antagonistic) organisms: myth or reality?**

*[Anton Milyaev](http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/dr.-anton-milyaev/)*

In this term paper, you will find evidence of using antagonistic organisms (fungi, bacteria and/or insects) to eliminate or reduce certain important pests and diseases in the orchards of temperate fruit trees. Search for examples of commercial use of such beneficial organisms. Are there ways to improve the existing methods? Would such biological plant protection methods substitute pesticide applications in the future?

**5. Influences of spring frost protection on the environment**

*[Christine Schmitz](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/christine-schmitz/)*

This term paper selects some frost protection measures and reviews the side effects of their use. It should include effects within in orchard as well as on the environment.

**6. Calcium nutrition of apple trees**

*[Christine Schmitz](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/christine-schmitz/)*

This term paper reviews calcium fertilization for apple trees. What is the current state of knowledge in research? What are the challenges and what is the effectiveness of calcium fertilization? It includes a short overview of the importance of calcium in apple trees.

**7. Rest breaking strategies in temperate fruit trees**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/)*

In many warm growing regions of temperate fruits, trees struggle to accumulate sufficient winter chill to break their dormancy. Climate change appears to be aggrevating this problem. Growers are therefore looking for, and in many cases already applying, strategies to artificially promote dormancy release. This term paper reviews the current state of knowledge on strategies for artificial rest-breaking and discusses the challenges and opportunities.

## Agroforestry

**8. The challenges of agroforestry modeling**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/), [Marcos Jimenez Martinez](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/marcos-jimenez-martinez/)*

Modeling agroforestry systems are more complex than monocultures, so they have presented considerable challenges to the modeling community. This term paper outlines these challenges and reviews how they have been addressed in previous modeling attempts.

**9. Barriers to agroforestry adoption in Germany (or elsewhere)**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/), [Marcos Jimenez Martinez](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/marcos-jimenez-martinez/)*

Many experts agree that agroforestry systems can offer environmental, economic and social benefits to farmers. Yet adoption rates often remain low due to an array of barriers that keep farmers from integrating trees with other agricultural practices. This term paper reviews these barriers and proposed ideas for overcoming them.

**10. Agroforestry in Germany (or elsewhere) - present distribution expansion potential**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/), [Marcos Jimenez Martinez](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/marcos-jimenez-martinez/)*

Agroforestry has gained traction in many places, yet its spread in Germany (and many other countries) has been slow. This term paper reviews what types of systems exist and where they can be found (possibly using case studies). It also speculates on the potential distribution within this geographic region.

## Greenhouse production systems & Hydroponics

**13. Sustainability of Greenhouse Production**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

In this term the focus will be on the sustainability of different cultivation systems in greenhouse production, mainly substrates and fertigation. The term paper should review the most important substrates and cultivation regimes and to compare them concerning sustainability.

**14. The challenges in lighting**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

One main advantage of greenhouse production is control of environmental conditions. Lighting is not only responsible for plant growth and performance yielding in an horticultural produce. Lighting can also control the quality of produce, it could support plant growth depending on growth stage. So the challange is, what is the optimal lighting? This term paper should focus on lighting source (natural vs. artifical) and the type of light (e.g. spectrum) and the meaning for plant growth. How could we control plant performance and quality by light?

**15. Green energy for greenhouses and vertical farms**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

Greenhouse production relies on energy for light and heating. In this term paper it should be discussed which forms of energy supply could be used for a more sustainable plant production. Would this makes a year-round production sustainable? What is the role of photovoltaic in this context?

## Ornamentals

**16. Sustainability of ornamental production**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

This term paper is a critical evaluation of ornamental production in different countries or different managment strategies. Based on a given example (e.g. roses) the term paper should review the available literature and studies.

**17. From ornamental plant to industrial crop**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

This term paper is focussing on ornamentals (e.g. flowers) and discuss what make them an ornamental plant in comparison to a horticultural crop. How could an ornamental be transformed into an industrial crop? What changes do occur during this transformation. How is an ornamental percepted by the consumer in comparison of an industrial crop? What changes in the production will take place when using an ornamental as feedstock for industry? The students work on an own example (e. g. edible flowers, ornamentals with interesting platform chemicals).

## Labor and gender issues in horticulture


## Disease management and protected cultivation

**20. How to protect plants in future?**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

Climate change will cause dramatic changes in horticulture. Horticultural production will move more and more to protected cultivation (e.g. tunnels, greenhouses). With that change in production new challenges in diesease management will arise. How we could protect our plants in future against climate change, weather extremes (e.g. drought) and new threats caused by insects or pathogens? In this term paper it should be analysed how climate change forced developments in horticulture (protected cultivation) and how this will affect disease management.

**21. Biostimulants and Biorationals as new and emerging tools in plant health**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

Biostimulants and biorationals are "new" ways to strengthen plants to improve growth and tolerance against environmental stress (biostimulants) or to protect plants in an environmental friendly way against pest and diseases to replace synthetic chemicals. In this term paper the different approaches will be discussed. What are the differences between biostimulants and biorationals? How could they be used effectively to strengthen plant health? A critical review of literature based on examples like humic acid (as biostimulant) or drying linseed oil (as biorational).

## Vertical farming

**22. â€¦ up to the sky**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

Vertical farming has gained a lot of interest, often with high expectations concerning the goals on feeding the world population or being more sustainable. In a critical review the term paper should highlight what has been achived in the past, where we stand today, and which expectations were not met (yet). But it should also show future trends and what could be reached in the future. Could vertical farms supply the world with food? In a critical review the aims & wishes but also the reality and and future should be considered. Are we really going up to the sky or do we fall like Ikarus being over optimistic? (this term paper is somewhat related to urban horticulture topic "Back to the roots...").

**23. Plant Factories**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

Is it not consequent to produce crops in a complete closed environment (called plant factory) to be more efficient and sustainable? Is the future of horticulture the industrial production of crops as feedstocks in production plants? In this term paper the state of art of plant factories and future prospects should be reviewed. In a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)  analysis trends and challenges will be discussed. 

## Urban horticulture

**24. Back to the rootsâ€¦**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

It seems that horticulture is coming back to the roots, closer to the consumer, and often back into the cities.  New forms of horticultural production have been and will be developed in an urban context (e.g community gardens, rooftop greenhouses and more). In this term paper these developments will be reviewed on basis of literature. How will horticultural production in cities look like in the future? What trends can be seen right now and what is the role of horticultural sciences and practice here? (This topic is somewhat related to Vertical farming topic "... up to the skies").

**25. Urban horticulture and the society**

*[Thorsten Kraska](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-thorsten-kraska/)*

In this term paper the meaning of urban horticulture for society should be discussed. New forms of horticulture raises societal questions. Different topics are possible: (1) Is urban horticulture a common good? (2) Edible landscaping. (3) Urban horticulture and recreation. (4) Bring in your own topic. The aim of this term paper is to think out of the box of "production" to explore the meaning of horticulture for humans and society.

## Climate change and horticulture

**26. Climate change impacts on fruit tree phenology**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/)*

This term paper reviews the recent literature regarding climate change impacts on (temperate) fruit tree phenology and their possible implications for production.

**27. Climate change impacts on (selected) horticultural pests and/or diseases**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/), [Prajna Kasargodu Anebagilu](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prajna-kasargodu-anebagilu/)*

This term paper selects a specific pest or disease (or a group of pests and diseases) of selected horticultural crops and reviews the evidence on how climate change is expected to affect it. It also critically evaluates the reliability of these expectations and speculates on implications for future production.

**28. The use of climate change denial strategies on other controversial issues**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/), [Prajna Kasargodu Anebagilu](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prajna-kasargodu-anebagilu/)*

The optional literature discusses "climate change denial strategies" that opponents of aggressive mitigation actions are pursuing. This paper selects another important societal debate with relevance to horticulture or agriculture and looks for applications of similar strategies there.

## Berries

**29. Organic vs. integrated production of berries: What is our future?**

*[Anton Milyaev](http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/dr.-anton-milyaev/)*

Make a comparison of berry production in organic and conventional farms. What are the main differences between these growing strategies? What are their advantages and challenges? Try to find any possible (reliable) information on yield, fruit quality, nutritional value, health benefits (antioxidants, vitamins etc.), costs and profits of berry production under the two management practices. Based on that information make your own prediction whether the organic production will dominate the conventional one in a few decades.


## Robotics and Digitalization

**31. Automation in Horticulture: Cutting valuable farm jobs or response to labour shortage?**

*[Lars Zimmermann](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/lars-zimmermann/), [Johannes Kopton](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/johannes-kopton/)*

Horticultural production is comparatively labour intensive. Recent advances in robotics and automatization enabled farm managers to reduce manual workload. Is this just a response to the decreased availability of seasonal farm workers from abroad, or is it rather an economic decision leaving potential farm workers unemployed? This term paper should answer the question from a social-economical perspective.

**32. Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) for Orchards: benefits and trade-offs for farm managers**

*[Lars Zimmermann](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/lars-zimmermann/), [Johannes Kopton](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/johannes-kopton/)*

In recent years Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) have become more and more powerful. Nowadays multiple such software solutions are available even for complex horticulture production. This term paper should point out reasons for using or not using FMIS, including initial expenses, daily workload, benefits of better information and decision support, data security, and other possible variables.

## Global horticulture for SDGs

**33. The contribution of horticulture to the Sustainable Development Goals with a specific focus on SDG 2**

*[Hannah Jaenicke](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/dr.-hannah-jaenicke/)*

In this term paper you will look into the various contributions horticultural production, processing and consumption make towards achieving the SDGs. You will also take a critical look into possible detrimental developments.
