### Questions

1. Describe a typical training system that is used for production of cane fruits.
2. What is the main soil requirement for the cultivation of blueberries? What is the advantage of using containers for blueberry production (especially in regards to soil requirements)?

## Instructions

This week, we also expect to take you for a short field trip to visit a demonstrative cane production plot in Endenich. So, make sure to dress appropriately!

## Literature for discussion

For the berry week, we will discuss the following paper: [Iñiguez-Moreno et al. 2024. Solutions for Postharvest Berry Protection: Natural Edible Coatings. Food Bioprocess Technol 17, 3483–3505.](https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/k111JI1bNhWsMeb), accessible with the password from [here](https://ecampus.uni-bonn.de/goto_ecampus_copa_3530257.html)).

Read the paper and discuss the strategies that help extend storage period and shelf life of berries. Think of your own ideas on how to further improve post-harvest berry quality.

## Term paper topics

**Flower drop and poor fruit set in grapes and currants: Causes, consequences, and control strategies**

*[Anton Milyaev](https://www.gartenbauwissenschaften.uni-bonn.de/en/staff/anton-milyaev)*

In commercial grape and currant production, large-scale failure of flowers to develop into berries (commonly referred to as “coulure” or “shatter”) represents a major challenge that can markedly reduce yields. In this paper you will explore the physiological basis of flower drop and poor fruit set in these crops, with particular attention to the processes of flower abscission. The discussion will highlight the influence of carbohydrate availability, hormonal regulation, and pollination success as key determinants of fruit set. In addition, the paper will review management strategies designed to mitigate yield losses, providing insights into both vineyard and currant orchard practices.
