### Questions

1. In a few lines, describe the main difference between the fruit production systems for pome and stone fruits. Link the process occurring inside the fruit and the changes that farmers could see.
2. What are the types of sunburn usually observed in apple orchards? How could farmers avoid this problem?

## Instructions

We'll be going for a walk with you. Depending on weather conditions, the ground may be wet or muddy, and it may be raining/snowing/windy etc. Make sure to dress appropriately! 

## Literature for discussion

This week we will discuss the following paper: [Kofler et al., 2019. High crop load and low temperature delay the onset of bud initiation in apple. Scientific Reports 9, 17986.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-54381-x)
Read the paper and discuss the tools that are used to study the mechanism of flower bud induction in apple.

Why is the understanding of the flower induction mechanism of particular importance for temperate fruit production? Please be critical while reading the work and try to find the confirmation of each key point described in the text with the data that is shown in the paper.

## Term paper topics

**Integrating agrophotovoltaic systems into orchard management: Can fruit trees and solar power effectively coexist?**

*[Anton Milyaev](http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/dr.-anton-milyaev/)*

Agrophotovoltaics (APV) involves the dual use of agricultural land for both crop production and solar energy generation. In this term paper, you will explore whether fruit tree orchards (such as apples, peaches, or cherries) can successfully coexist with solar panels. Investigate the impact of shading on tree growth, flowering, fruit production, fruit quality, and on the occurrence of pests and diseases. How orchard management practices would need to adapt to optimize both solar and agricultural yields? Consider examples of existing APV projects in orchards and their economic and environmental outcomes. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of integrating APV into commercial orchards?

**Chilling requirements and global warming: Can we adjust photoperiod to compensate for winter chill in plants?**

*[Anton Milyaev](http://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/author/dr.-anton-milyaev/)*

Global warming is reducing the accumulation of chilling temperatures necessary for temperate fruit trees to break dormancy and flower properly. In this paper, you will investigate whether manipulating the photoperiod during the winter months could compensate for a lack of chilling. Review the biological and physiological processes behind photoperiod and dormancy in plants (with focus on fruit trees). Present you literature research on how light manipulation (e.g., shortened or extended daylight exposure, certain light spectra, etc.) might affect dormancy and whether the photoperiod can help adjust, reduce or replace chilling needs.

**Influences of spring frost protection on the environment**

*[Christine Schmitz](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/christine-schmitz/)*

This term paper selects some frost protection measures and reviews the side effects of their use. It should include effects within in orchard as well as on the environment.

**Calcium nutrition of apple trees**

*[Christine Schmitz](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/christine-schmitz/)*

This term paper reviews calcium fertilization for apple trees. What is the current state of knowledge in research? What are the challenges and what is the effectiveness of calcium fertilization? It includes a short overview of the importance of calcium in apple trees.

**Rest breaking strategies in temperate fruit trees**

*[Eike Luedeling](http://www.hortibonn.de/author/prof.-dr.-eike-luedeling/)*

In many warm growing regions of temperate fruits, trees struggle to accumulate sufficient winter chill to break their dormancy. Climate change appears to be aggrevating this problem. Growers are therefore looking for, and in many cases already applying, strategies to artificially promote dormancy release. This term paper reviews the current state of knowledge on strategies for artificial rest-breaking and discusses the challenges and opportunities.
