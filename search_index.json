Let me quickly introduce myself. My name is Eike Luedeling, and I lead the Horticultural Sciences group in the Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES). In bringing this module to you, I’m supported by a strong team: Anton Milyaev, Christine Schmitz, Cory Whitney, Hannah Jaenicke, Jan Ellenberger, Johannes Kopton, Katja Schiffers, Lars Zimmermann, Marcos Jimenez Martinez, Prajna Kasargodu Anebagilu, Thorsten Kraska, The materials assembled on this website support the lecture on Horticultural Production and Research in the Winter Semester of 2023/2024. The current plan is to offer these lectures ‘in presence’, i.e. we’ll all meet in the lecture hall Auf dem Hügel 6 in Bonn-Endenich. The lecture times are Wednesdays 08:30-10:00 and Thursdays 12:15-13:45 between 11th October 2023 and 1st February 2024. Module content Horticulture is a very broad topic that we can’t cover comprehensively in a single module. Besides, being the MSc students that you are, you’re entitled to a certain level of depth, which we wouldn’t be able to reach if we tried covering everything. So we decided to concentrate on a few topics that we thought you’ll find interesting. This is a mixture of impressions about particular production systems and current topics that are at the forefront of horticultural research and/or public debate. Inverted classroom We’re going to try something new in this class - an inverted classroom format. This basically means that we’re not just going to be talking at you when we’re all in class. Instead, we’ll try to facilitate your learning by engaging in a participatory process that will require you to actually do stuff, rather than just listening to what we have to say. The format of this active session will vary across the different topic, so that this doesn’t get boring. During our participatory sessions, we want you to consolidate what you’ve learned - which of course requires that you’ve already learned something. Much of the subject-matter content will therefore be presented to you in digital format, to be studied before class. We’ll provide some guiding questions to help you with your studies. We’ll also have sessions where we discuss the content of scientific publications. So each week, you’ll be given a reading assignment, which we’ll then talk about in class. You will be facilitating these discussions yourselves, so you may want to think of some leading questions to guide the conversations. Communication You’ll receive most information related to the class via this website. We also invite you to join the Slack workspace for this module. Slack is a platform that facilitates collaboration within teams or organizations that we’ve found very effective for organizing class contents. The invitation to Slack is on eCampus (you’ll need your Uni-ID to log in). Please sign up with your university email address. We’ll share announcements through Slack, and we also encourage you to organize your group work via this platform. You’ll get a brief introduction into Slack in our first session. Grading There’s no exam in this module, but you’ll be required to deliver a few other things: Write and submit short synopses of what you learned in each of the interactive sessions (10%). Write and submit succinct answers to the practice questions (10%). Lead at least two paper discussion sessions and participate actively in discussions led by others (20%). Prepare a term paper on one of the lecture topics (40%). Present the content of your term paper to your peers towards the end of the paper (20%). You’re also expected to come to class prepared and participate actively in the interactive sessions and paper discussions. Lecture topics In each of the 15 weeks of the semester, we’ll cover one topic. After week 1, we’ll have our interactive session every Wednesday (08:30-10:00). On Thursdays, we’ll split into smaller groups to discuss the papers you’ll have read. We’re estimating that this will take us about an hour. The remainder of the time can be (and should be) spent working on and talking about the term papers. We may have some more inputs on academic writing, but this is mainly your chance to get our advice - make sure to use this opportunity! Here’s a tentative schedule for this module (some details may still change): Week 01: Introduction to horticulture Week 02: Temperate fruits Week 03: Berries Week 04: Agroforestry Week 05: Global horticulture for SDGs Week 06: From Greenhouse Production to Plant Factories Week 07: From Urban Horticulture to Social Gardening Week 08: Scientific writing and New plants for a future-competent horticultural production part 1 Week 09: New plants for a future-competent horticultural production part 2 Week 10: Safeguarding Plant Health in Horticulture Week 11: Climate Change and Horticulture Week 12: Gender in Horticulture Week 13: Assessing Environmental Impacts Week 14: Student presentations Week 15: Student presentations The contents and instructions will be added to this website in the course of the semester. In addition to the lectures, we’re preparing some instruction materials on Scientific writing, which we’ll make available here too. Introductory materials from week 1 Here’s the introduction to the class. Here you can find some information about the term paper. "],["introhort.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction to horticulture 1.1 Term paper topics", " Chapter 1 Introduction to horticulture by Eike Luedeling In week 1, we’re not in inverted classrom mode yet, so this week’s content will consist of an introductory lecture about horticulture. Here are the slides on the introductory lecture on the colorful world of horticulture. 1.1 Term paper topics Horticultural vs. agricultural staple crop research capacity and funding - a comparison Eike Luedeling This term paper compares available research capacity and funding for horticultural crops and staple crop agriculture. This evaluation can focus on a particular geographic context, for which it summarizes the research landscape (universities, other institutes) and funding streams. Horticultural diversity and its regions of origin Eike Luedeling This paper summarizes the evidence on the diversity of horticultural crops that humanity makes use of. It also reviews the literature on the geographic (and possibly cultural) origins of this diversity. "],["temperate-fruits.html", "Chapter 2 Temperate fruits 2.1 Materials 2.2 Instructions 2.3 Literature for discussion 2.4 Term paper topics", " Chapter 2 Temperate fruits by Eike Luedeling, Christine Schmitz, Eduardo Fernandez and Anton Milyaev 2.1 Materials To prepare for class, please watch the following four videos: General concepts (password here) Nuts (password here) Stone fruits (password here) Pome fruits (password here) As supplementary material, we also offer two videos on sweet cherry bloom and apple varieties recorded by our HortiWood team: Apple varieties (password here) Sweet cherry bloom (password here) You need the module password from eCampus to access these files. 2.1.1 Questions In a few lines, describe the main difference between the fruit production systems for pome and stone fruits. Link the process occurring inside the fruit and the changes that farmers could see. What are the types of sunburn usually observed in apple orchards? How could farmers avoid this problem? 2.2 Instructions We’ll be going for a walk with you. Depending on weather conditions, the ground may be wet or muddy, and it may be raining/snowing/windy etc. Make sure to dress appropriately! 2.3 Literature for discussion This week we will discuss the following paper: Kofler et al., 2019. High crop load and low temperature delay the onset of bud initiation in apple. Scientific Reports 9, 17986. Read the paper and discuss the tools that are used to study the mechanism of flower bud induction in apple. Why is the understanding of the flower induction mechanism of particular importance for temperate fruit production? Please be critical while reading the work and try to find the confirmation of each key point described in the text with the data that is shown in the paper. 2.4 Term paper topics Integrating agrophotovoltaic systems into orchard management: Can fruit trees and solar power effectively coexist? Anton Milyaev Agrophotovoltaics (APV) involves the dual use of agricultural land for both crop production and solar energy generation. In this term paper, you will explore whether fruit tree orchards (such as apples, peaches, or cherries) can successfully coexist with solar panels. Investigate the impact of shading on tree growth, flowering, fruit production, fruit quality, and on the occurrence of pests and diseases. How orchard management practices would need to adapt to optimize both solar and agricultural yields? Consider examples of existing APV projects in orchards and their economic and environmental outcomes. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of integrating APV into commercial orchards? Chilling requirements and global warming: Can we adjust photoperiod to compensate for winter chill in plants? Anton Milyaev Global warming is reducing the accumulation of chilling temperatures necessary for temperate fruit trees to break dormancy and flower properly. In this paper, you will investigate whether manipulating the photoperiod during the winter months could compensate for a lack of chilling. Review the biological and physiological processes behind photoperiod and dormancy in plants (with focus on fruit trees). Present you literature research on how light manipulation (e.g., shortened or extended daylight exposure, certain light spectra, etc.) might affect dormancy and whether the photoperiod can help adjust, reduce or replace chilling needs. Influences of spring frost protection on the environment Christine Schmitz Frost protection measures are great for reducing yield losses caused by spring frosts. But how do they influence the environment, within the orchard, in the surrounding area? You could also include social influences. Select a few frost protection measures and collect information, e.g. from scientific and practical literature, to give an overview about the side effects of frost protection. Apple fruit color Christine Schmitz For red and bi-colored apple varieties, fruit color is a crucial factor for fruit quality class and marketing. But how do apples get their color? What are the possible reasons for insufficient fruit coloration? And how could farmers improve the fruit coloring? Give a very brief overview of process of fruit coloring and focus your literature research on reasons for missing color and measures to increase the share of red peel color. Rest breaking strategies in temperate fruit trees Eike Luedeling In many warm growing regions of temperate fruits, trees struggle to accumulate sufficient winter chill to break their dormancy. Climate change appears to be aggrevating this problem. Growers are therefore looking for, and in many cases already applying, strategies to artificially promote dormancy release. This term paper reviews the current state of knowledge on strategies for artificial rest-breaking and discusses the challenges and opportunities.

You can find these documents here: Slides (password here) Cultivation of blueberry (password here) Cultivation of raspberry (password here) Cultivation of currants (password here) 3.1.1 Questions Describe a typical training system that is used for production of cane fruits. What is the main soil requirement for the cultivation of blueberries? What is the advantage of using containers for blueberry production (especially in regards to soil requirements)? 3.2 Instructions This week, we also expect to take you for a short field trip to visit a demonstrative cane production plot in Endenich. So, make sure to dress appropriately! 3.3 Literature for discussion For the berry week, we will discuss the following paper: Iñiguez-Moreno et al. 2024. Solutions for Postharvest Berry Protection: Natural Edible Coatings. Food Bioprocess Technol 17, 3483–3505., accessible with the password from here). Read the paper and discuss the strategies that help extend storage period and shelf life of berries. Think of your own ideas on how to further improve post-harvest berry quality. 3.4 Term paper topics Berry plants and declining bee communities: Will the berry production still be possible without pollinators? Anton Milyaev Many plant species rely on pollinators, such as bees and other insects, that are essential for the fertilization of flowers. Scientists currently express their concerns that year after year there are less and less insects including bees due to the intensive insecticide use in agriculture. Does the yield of berry plants (raspberries, blueberries, currents, blackberries, etc.) also depend on pollinators? If yes, to what extent? Is berry production possible without pollinating insects? In this term paper, you will investigate how pollinator presence affects the pollination efficiency, fruit set, and overall yield of berry crops, and strategies to enhance pollination. "],["agroforestry.html", "Chapter 4 Agroforestry 4.1 Materials 4.2 Instructions 4.3 Literature for discussion 4.4 Term paper topics", " Chapter 4 Agroforestry by Katja Schiffers, Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez and Cory Whitney Agroforestry refers to a land-use system that integrates trees or shrubs into agricultural land and/or livestock farming. By diversifying production it can generate social, economic and environmental benefits. Agroforestry is also increasingly recognized as one of the most promising land use options for addressing multiple Sustainable Development Goals and confronting the challenges of climate change mitigation, food security, soil degradation, decline of biodiversity and desertification. 4.1 Materials The following three videos will give you a first overview of what agroforestry is, what it can contribute, and what it looks like in practice: 4.1.1 What is agroforestry? Here are the slides that belong to this video. 4.1.2 What does agroforestry contribute? Here are the slides that belong to this video. 4.1.3 Agroforestry examples Here are the slides that belong to this video. 4.1.4 Agroforestry in the European Union Also go through the following briefing document, developed for the European Parliament, which outlines the current situation and legal setting of agroforestry in Europe: Agroforestry in the European Union You can also find this on eCampus. 4.1.5 Questions (or rather “assignments” today) Name the three basic types of agroforestry according to the most commonly used classification system. Name seven reasons why a farmer may benefit from introducing agroforestry on her farm. Briefly describe two examples of agroforestry systems (in up to three sentences each). Name three constraints to the implementation of agroforestry in Europe. 4.2 Instructions This week we’ll take a shot at designing an agroforestry system. You’ll get more detailed instructions in class. 4.3 Literature for discussion We’re discussing the following paper: Tsonkova et al. 2018: Addressing farmer-perceptions and legal constraints to promote agroforestry in Germany.

This is the long-awaited second edition of the “An Introduction to Agroforestry” - a seminal textbook by PK Nair et al. that was first published in 1991: An Introduction to Agroforestry 4.4 Term paper topics The challenges of agroforestry modeling Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Modeling agroforestry systems are more complex than monocultures, so they have presented considerable challenges to the modeling community. This term paper outlines these challenges and reviews how they have been addressed in previous modeling attempts. Barriers to agroforestry adoption in Germany (or elsewhere) Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Many experts agree that agroforestry systems can offer environmental, economic and social benefits to farmers. Yet adoption rates often remain low due to an array of barriers that keep farmers from integrating trees with other agricultural practices. This term paper reviews these barriers and proposed ideas for overcoming them. Agroforestry in Germany (or elsewhere) - present distribution expansion potential Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Agroforestry has gained traction in many places, yet its spread in Germany (and many other countries) has been slow. This term paper reviews what types of systems exist and where they can be found (possibly using case studies). It also speculates on the potential distribution within this geographic region.

In this week we will take a closer look at greenhouse production and vertical farming. At first we will understand what a greenhouse in its principles is. We are doing this in the greenhouse at the institute. After the visit in the greenhouse we will discuss the transformation of greenhouse production into “closed environment agriculture” (CEO), alos called indoor farming, vertical farming, or plant factories. In the paper discussion we will try to answer the question: “Is Indoor Farming the solution” for feeding the world? 6.1 Materials Greenhouse Production Systems (Part 1) Greenhouse Production Systems (Part 2) 6.2 Instructions Please watch both videos carefully to get a general introduction into greenhouse production systems. The videos are the basis for further discussion in the inverted classroom. Pay special attention to the equipment and infrastructure of a greenhouse. We will start the week with a visit of a greenhouse at the institute to discuss and compare the information given in the videos with a real situation. A special emphasis will be given to “light” and “lighting”. Following questions may help you for preparation: How is light in a greenhouse different from the field and what does it mean for plant cultivation? How are light and lighting affecting plant yield and produce quality in a greenhouse? How can the lighting be adapted to the needs of the plants? How can light and lighting be modified (management strategies, infrastructure)? What is the meaning of UV-light and far red light? You will find further readings on light (especially LED) and lighting on eCampus. 6.3 Literature for discussion Paper discussion: We will discuss the article “Wheat yield potential in controlled-environment vertical farms” by Asseng et al. (2020)(see eCampus). The article is not on a horticultural crop, but a good case study, which could be transferred to other crops, too. There are two tasks: 1. General discussion: Are indoor farm suited to produce enough staple food for a growing population and not just “baby greens” for a more healthy lifestyle? 2. Specific topic: The article is short (5 pages), but full of details and assumptions. Let us do a fact check. Please read the article and prepare yourself for the discussion by checking at least one fact by using the cited references (1st order references) and maybe follow the path of data. 6.4 Term paper topics Can plant factories safe the world? Thorsten Kraska In this term paper you should evaluate which crops are already produced in plant factories (here used as a general term for all indoor farms, vertical farms, or controlled environment farms) and which crops are challenging. For crops already produced in plant factories compare yields and / or energy consumption to conventional farming systems. For crops not produced so far, discuss the challenging factors within a plant factory and how they could be solved. For heaven`s sake use LED - the challenges in lighting Thorsten Kraska One main advantage of greenhouse production is control of environmental conditions. Lighting is not only responsible for plant growth and performance yielding in an horticultural produce. Lighting can also control the quality of produce, it could support plant growth depending on growth stage. So the challenge is, what is the optimal lighting? This term paper should focus on LED lighting. How could we control plant performance and quality by light? It’s all about energy - how photovoltaic can be used for greenhouses and plant factories Thorsten Kraska Greenhouse production and plant factories depend on energy for light and heating. In this term paper it should be discussed which role photovoltaic will have for a more sustainable plant production. Would this makes a year-round production possible? Discover possible new trends how photovoltaic could be used in the future.

A special focus was given on technology and how horticultural production will change. This week we will give a focus on different perspectives on Urban Horticulture. Based on your knowledge we will focus on the perspectives of (1) non-professionals (laymen, consumer, society) and professionals (gardeners, industry). 7.1 Materials The starting point is the article by Feldmann and Vogler (2019). You will find the article in eCampus with text highlighted. Additional readings can be found in eCampus. You might find them helpful to explore on the topic. All materials are available for download in eCampus. 7.2 Instructions The groups should use the material above as starting point for their perspectives: Group 1: perspective of non-professionals, consumer, community, and society Group 2: perspective of professionals, gardeners, farmers, retailers, industry, market Build your own opinion based on the given perspective for the group, which you could use. For preparation you should consider the following: What are the expectations of non-professionals / professionals for a successful Urban Horticulture? Which elements of Urban Horticulture (e.g. cultivation systems, size, plants) do the different perspectives focus on? What do non-professionals and professionals share? What are the expectations of non-professionals for professional and vice versa What are the challenges in Urban Horticulture? What role will „digitalization” and „technology” have? How do non-professionals differ from professionals and what does this mean? How will roles of non-professionals and professionals change in the transition of future Urban Horticulture During class the groups will develop a concept of Urban Horticulture from one of the two perspectives. 7.3 Questions How is Urban Horticulture defined? Define “Smart cities” in the context of Urban Horticulture 7.4 Literature for discussion This week we will discuss two papers: Group 1: Dorr et al. (2021). Environmental impacts and resource use of urban agriculture: a systematic review and meta-analysis Group 2: Payen et al. (2022): How Much Food Can We Grow in Urban Areas? Food Production and Crop Yields of Urban Agriculture: A Meta-Analysis Both articles are meta-analyses on the subject of (1) environmental impact and (2) food production in Urban Horticulture. This week’s tasks: To get the essentials from the respective paper. What are the main findings? What are the main conclusions? Both articles are meta-analyses. What could be achieved with this kind of study approach? Could this lead to new research directions? In class the two groups will have about 30 minutes to discuss the paper within the group and to prepare up to 3 slides (e.g. Powerpoint) including (1) a graph or table from the paper with main findings, (2) Summary of main findings, (3) what research should be done according to the outcome of the paper, and (4) a suggestions for a research project (title only) which you would do inspired by the article. 7.5 Term paper topics Back to the roots… Thorsten Kraska It seems that horticulture is coming back to the roots, closer to the consumer, and often back into the cities. New forms of horticultural production have been and will be developed in an urban context (e.g community gardens, rooftop greenhouses and more). In this term paper these developments will be reviewed on basis of literature. How will horticultural production in cities look like in the future? What trends can be seen right now and what is the role of horticultural sciences and practice here? (This topic is somewhat related to Vertical farming topic “… up to the skies”). Urban horticulture and the society Thorsten Kraska In this term paper the meaning of urban horticulture for society should be discussed. New forms of horticulture raises societal questions. Different topics are possible: (1) Is urban horticulture a common good? (2) Edible landscaping. (3) Urban horticulture and recreation. (4) Bring in your own topic. The aim of this term paper is to think out of the box of “production” to explore the meaning of horticulture for humans and society.

Instead of getting a vague overview of vegetable production as a whole, we focus on two of the many sub-areas of vegetable production that are currently attracting a great deal of interest: Many vegetable farms in Germany and throughout Europe are (were?) particularly affected by the current energy crisis. The first two pieces of information below deal with this issue in different ways. We spend half of the time on Wednesday talking about this issue. Therefore, I would like to ask you to have read the materials by then and possibly read up on this topic beyond these two snippets. We will use the second 45 minutes on Wednesday to look at another aspect. You may know that parts of our working group are particularly interested in biodiverse agricultural production systems where very different plant species grow on the same piece of land. We are quite confident that this can be a way to do sustainable intensive agriculture. The second two pieces of information deal with such complex horticultural production systems. 9.1 Materials news article on the effects of the energy crisis on vegetable producers and production very recent article, reaction to the German energy cost subsidies.

Isn’t it more reasonable to produce vegetables for the European winter market in northern Africa? should the year-round availability of fresh vegetables like tomatoes and bell pepper at low prizes be a political aim in central Europe? Vegetable production in complex systems What are the main drivers for the rather simple produciton systems currently dominating vegetable production in Europe? How can digitalization change this situation? Should the existence of complex vegetable production systems be a policy objective in Europe? Why (not)? Meta-question: What is your impression of the sources offered in terms of their credibility and quality? 9.3 Further reading Here’s a loose list of material I stumbled across when preparing the lecture.

Not in large fields with monocultures, but in a small, complex market garden, the robot will roll in the future. With a lot of experience and knowledge, such a market garden can generate more than €150,000 per hectare in a year. But it takes a lot of experience. Speaker 2 (00:30) Here with these systems is that they are incredibly complex. I have mixed crops, I have everything in a very small space, I have quite a lot of different crops. I have a high level of biodiversity. Speaker 1 (00:40) Lots of work and lots of potential for robots. In the future, it should monitor plants as they grow, detect unwanted weeds, diseases and pests at an early stage. That is the vision of the research team. Speaker 3 (00:54) We want to accompany the plant from the ground up, so to speak, really as baby seedlings or as seeds all the way to full-grown plants. Speaker 1 (01:07) How do I build nutrient-rich soil? What plants are suitable neighbors in a market garden? What beneficial insects help fight disease? Many know that gardeners learn as they go, through experience. Speaker 2 (01:20) And I remember it from my past. Nothing is as unsatisfying as feeling like you’re working in the garden all day and still can’t get it done. Speaker 1 (01:27) The robot is supposed to avoid such disappointments. The plan: artificial intelligence evaluates the data from the garden, provides an overview and recommends concrete measures for the garden. The tips are intended to help the gardeners succeed as quickly as possible in growing vegetables in market gardens, which is considerably more time-consuming than conventional production. Speaker 4 (01:47) You can think of it as basically like the new invention of printing, so to speak. Back then, when you had certain theses or you had certain knowledge, you tried to preserve that and share that. And we would now no longer write a book, but we make machine-readable knowledge, which we make available to the users via our hardware, our robotics as well as via our software. Speaker 1 (02:06) And as close to nature as possible. Food is already being grown in high-tech greenhouses thanks to artificial intelligence, but in monocultures using only nutrient solution. There is also high-tech in the garden, but new habitats for animals and plants are also being created. The research team is still in the early stages. Robot Lero is a first prototype created within eight months in the workshop. Now it must learn to move autonomously and recognize the plants as well as possible with the help of artificial intelligence. Three D maps, which are repeatedly recreated, form the basis for analyzing each individual plant in detail. Next year, the robot will be rolling and collecting data at farmer Julian Plagemann’s farm. The organic farmer has been growing vegetables in a small market garden here for four years. Not an easy task. Speaker 5 (03:02) My grandfather always said that you couldn’t grow vegetables here, and now I can build up a regional supply of vegetables by building up the soil massively. That may be a model for others, perhaps for every village at some point, but we have, as far as I know in the Münsterland a vegetable self-sufficiency of 0.5% and I would like to counteract that. Speaker 1 (03:31) With his 1.5 hectare market garden, the organic farmer can currently feed over 60 people. He has loyal regular customers who reserve the vegetables online and pick them up themselves. Speaker 5 (03:43) I think making money through mass is more difficult than marketing directly in small quantities and delivering quality. Speaker 1 (03:54) The farmer still wants to expand his vegetable garden, but is reaching his limits and is eager to see how the robot can support him here next year. And he already has an extra wish. Speaker 5 (04:07) It would be conceivable, for example, to use the robot to make an inventory of the ripe vegetables, so that, for example, he doesn’t have to go through the beds himself every week to see what will probably be ripe by the end of next week. Speaker 1 (04:22) In the future, farmers could also network to share information about diseases and pests. Speaker 2 (04:29) That means I can monitor pest flights. They are there, after all. If one farm has the first insect, it will soon appear on the other farms. The moment I’m more connected, I can use those networks to also install advance warning systems much more efficiently, do much smarter cooperation. I can exchange with workers and farms if I know who has what in the fields and how. Speaker 1 (04:52) Orchards could also be monitored by robot in the future. There are also plans to use it in viticulture. Now the research team first has to build a new second prototype. The team has also already founded a start up, would like to stand on its own two feet in 2023. They hope that through their research, more farmers will rely on small vegetable gardens in the future. 9.6 Term paper topics Vegetable production in Germany in the context of the current energy crisis Jan Ellenberger Vegetable production - especially year-round production under glass - is extremely energy-intensive and in many parts still based on fossil fuels. What does the current energy crisis mean for domestic vegetable production? What are the farms doing, what is the political support and what prices can we expect for locally produced vegetables? Vegetables in complex production systems Jan Ellenberger The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the integration of vegetables into complex production systems. In a global context, it becomes clear that growing similar vegetables on large areas is not the only possible form of production. Can more complex cropping systems also be successful in Germany? Do they even already exist?

It will foster innovations in horticulture to come to a more resilient production. On the forefront of these innovations is urban horticulture and any kind of protect cultivation to make production sustainable and more resilient against risks posed by abiotic factors (e.g. climate change, drought, temperatures), biotic factors (e.g. pest and diseases, new emerging threats), and societal risks like pandemic outbreaks endangering production, distribution of food, and food safety. We have already discussed the meaning of protected cultivation and vertical farms from a general point of view. In this session we will focus on two topics: On the first day we will discuss protected cultivation and urban horticulture on the background of possible pandemics. On the 2nd day we will focus on pest management in an urbanized horticultural system. 10.1 Materials Opinion paper: Food First: COVID-19 Outbreak and Cities Lockdown a Booster for a Wider Vision on Urban Agriculture Review paper: The Impact of COVID-19 on Horticulture: Critical Issues and Opportunities Derived from an Unexpected Occurrence Both articles are open access, so you should be able to access them. 10.2 Instructions Inverted classroom: Please read the Opinion paper and prepare your own answer to it based on your own knowledge and experience. Use the review paper for more detailed information on the topic or use information of the more than 40 articles citing the opinion paper (use Web of Science) or other articles discussing the meaning of pandemic outbreaks on the meaning of protected cultivation. The major goal is to get a well-founded opinion on the meaning of pandemic outbreaks on research in the field protected cultivation as well as disease management. Based on your input we will discuss. Guiding questions: Do new or emerging risks (e.g. pandemic outbreaks) change horticultural production? Are possible changes reversible or will they set the path for future directions in horticulture? How could we come to a risk resilient horticultural production? How could we come to a future-proofed production? Beside a general discussion we would discuss it on a more specific example on “pest management”. How would the changes affect crop management (plant health, pest control) in the future? In this context I recommend the following articles for introduction: Feldmann et al. Biostimulants, soil improvers, bioprotectants: promoters of bio‑intensification in plant production. Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection (2022) 129:707–713 Feldmann &amp; Carstensen. Efficacy and risks of ‘‘biorationals’’. Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection (2018) 125:517–521 10.3 Literature for discussion While on the first day the focus was on Urban Horticulture and protected cultivation, the 2nd day will focus on pest management. In the paper discussion we will bring together Urban Horticulture and pest management. We will discuss: Feldmann and Vogler (2021). Towards sustainable performance of urban horticulture: ten challenging fields of action for modern integrated pest management in cities.. In the article 10 challenges concerning pest management are addressed. Your task is to order these challenges according to your own opinion of importance. For the most important challenge you should find supporting arguments. For the less important challenge you should give reasons why. As an additional task you could try to find a supporting article for the challenge you gave highest priority. ## Term paper topics How to protect plants in future? Thorsten Kraska Climate change will cause dramatic changes in horticulture. Horticultural production will move more and more to protected cultivation (e.g. tunnels, greenhouses). With that change in production new challenges in diesease management will arise. How we could protect our plants in future against climate change, weather extremes (e.g. drought) and new threats caused by insects or pathogens? In this term paper it should be analysed how climate change forced developments in horticulture (protected cultivation) and how this will affect disease management. Biostimulants and Biorationals as new and emerging tools in plant health Thorsten Kraska Biostimulants and biorationals are “new” ways to strengthen plants to improve growth and tolerance against environmental stress (biostimulants) or to protect plants in an environmental friendly way against pest and diseases to replace synthetic chemicals. In this term paper the different approaches will be discussed. What are the differences between biostimulants and biorationals? How could they be used effectively to strengthen plant health? A critical review of literature based on examples like humic acid (as biostimulant) or drying linseed oil (as biorational).

We’ll be working in groups in this lesson. Each group will be in charge of assessing climatic challenges to a specific horticultural system - and of figuring out what needs to happen for this system to transition into a climatically viable and sustainable production system in the future. We have three groups in this class this year. Here is your assigned production system: Group 1: You’re a sweet cherry grower in northern Spain. Your farm has 5 hectares, you’re using a modern production system, and you’re selling fresh fruit to a major fruit distribution company. You inherited the farm from your parents, who have been operating in the same location for the past 50 years. So far, you have stuck to the same cherry cultivars you have always grown, because you have experience with them and they are easy to market. Group 2: You’re a tomato grower in southern Spain, in the Alméria region. Your farm includes 8 ha of protected cultivation, where you grow tomatoes in greenhouses (mostly with plastic covers). You invested 20 years ago in (then) state-of-the art technology to set up your farm. Some loans still haven’t been paid off, but you’re making good money. Your products are sold all over Europe, and you’re working with major vegetable distributors to get them there. Your system is quite labor-intensive, and you rely on artificial irrigation and soilless cultivation. Group 3: You’re an asparagus grower in the Rhineland region of Germany. You own two hectares of asparagus fields, which you inherited from your parents. You market your strongly seasonal product locally, working with a vendor at a local farmer’s market and selling some of the asparagus directly on the farm. Some produce is also sold through a local grocery store. 11.1 Materials If you want, you can check out some introductory videos on climate change that I made a few years ago. They mostly belong to my lecture on Tree phenology analysis with R, but they may also be of interest in the context of this lesson. More importantly, please take a look at the following group-specific sources. You don’t have to dig deep into all the methods, but try to get a feeling for what challenges your crop is likely to experience as a consequence of climate change. Group 1: Fernandez et al. 2023.

What other social, environmental or economic challenges do you think your farm is experiencing? 11.3 Instructions Discuss the following questions in your group and work on the assignment. Prepare for a 5-minute presentation at the end of the class. What climate-related challenges do you foresee in the medium and long term? What adaptation-related decisions do you expect? What major constraints to taking adaptation action do you foresee? How could new legislation related to climate change (and environmental issues) affect your farm operations? Backcasting exercise: Let’s imagine that your farm is still going strong in 2050. It is economically viable, resilient to climate change impacts and (to the extent possible) environmentally sustainable. What does that future version of your farm look like? What changes did you have to make to get there? Outline your adaptation pathway in prospective hindsight. Prepare a brief (~5 minute) presentation to present your farm to your fellow students. Present the current and the future, as well as the pathway that enabled you to make the transition (including major decisions and changes). 11.4 Literature for discussion Bisbis et al., 2019.

"],["assessing-environmental-impacts.html", "Chapter 13 Assessing Environmental Impacts 13.1 Term paper topics", " Chapter 13 Assessing Environmental Impacts by Lars Zimmermann and Johannes Kopton This week, we are looking at how to assess the environmental impacts of horticultural production. Specifically, you will learn how to measure the environmental footprint (e.g. carbon or water footprint) of a production system. To do that, we are going to talk about a method called Lifecycle Assessment (LCA). It allows us to quantify all environmental impacts, from the production of resources (e.g. green houses, inputs, tractors, fuel, …) over direct emissions to the disposal/recycling of waste. On Thursday, we are going to have a hands-on exercise and learn how to create a simple LCA using open source tools and free data. Please bring your own laptops, if you can!

The environmental impact of transportation in context Johannes Kopton, Lars Zimmermann Tomatoes from Spain, bananas from Indonesia, apples from Chile. Horticultural products can come a long way, quite literally. Or we might buy them from the farm just around the corner. How does it impact the environmental footprint? Is regional always better? Organic or integrated production - sustainability in apple production Lars Zimmermann, Johannes Kopton There are two basic cultivation paradigms in apple growing: Organic and integrated production. In organic cultivation, no synthetic pesticides and fertilizers are used, but more intensive use of machinery is required. How do the environmental footprints of the two cultivation methods differ?

Horticultural vs. agricultural staple crop research capacity and funding - a comparison Eike Luedeling This term paper compares available research capacity and funding for horticultural crops and staple crop agriculture. This evaluation can focus on a particular geographic context, for which it summarizes the research landscape (universities, other institutes) and funding streams. 2. Horticultural diversity and its regions of origin Eike Luedeling This paper summarizes the evidence on the diversity of horticultural crops that humanity makes use of. It also reviews the literature on the geographic (and possibly cultural) origins of this diversity. 14.2 Temperate fruits 3. Integrating agrophotovoltaic systems into orchard management: Can fruit trees and solar power effectively coexist? Anton Milyaev Agrophotovoltaics (APV) involves the dual use of agricultural land for both crop production and solar energy generation. In this term paper, you will explore whether fruit tree orchards (such as apples, peaches, or cherries) can successfully coexist with solar panels. Investigate the impact of shading on tree growth, flowering, fruit production, fruit quality, and on the occurrence of pests and diseases. How orchard management practices would need to adapt to optimize both solar and agricultural yields? Consider examples of existing APV projects in orchards and their economic and environmental outcomes. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of integrating APV into commercial orchards? 4. Chilling requirements and global warming: Can we adjust photoperiod to compensate for winter chill in plants? Anton Milyaev Global warming is reducing the accumulation of chilling temperatures necessary for temperate fruit trees to break dormancy and flower properly. In this paper, you will investigate whether manipulating the photoperiod during the winter months could compensate for a lack of chilling. Review the biological and physiological processes behind photoperiod and dormancy in plants (with focus on fruit trees). Present you literature research on how light manipulation (e.g., shortened or extended daylight exposure, certain light spectra, etc.) might affect dormancy and whether the photoperiod can help adjust, reduce or replace chilling needs. 5. Influences of spring frost protection on the environment Christine Schmitz Frost protection measures are great for reducing yield losses caused by spring frosts. But how do they influence the environment, within the orchard, in the surrounding area? You could also include social influences. Select a few frost protection measures and collect information, e.g. from scientific and practical literature, to give an overview about the side effects of frost protection. 6. Apple fruit color Christine Schmitz For red and bi-colored apple varieties, fruit color is a crucial factor for fruit quality class and marketing. But how do apples get their color? What are the possible reasons for insufficient fruit coloration? And how could farmers improve the fruit coloring? Give a very brief overview of process of fruit coloring and focus your literature research on reasons for missing color and measures to increase the share of red peel color. 7. Rest breaking strategies in temperate fruit trees Eike Luedeling In many warm growing regions of temperate fruits, trees struggle to accumulate sufficient winter chill to break their dormancy. Climate change appears to be aggrevating this problem. Growers are therefore looking for, and in many cases already applying, strategies to artificially promote dormancy release. This term paper reviews the current state of knowledge on strategies for artificial rest-breaking and discusses the challenges and opportunities. 14.3 Berries 8. Berry plants and declining bee communities: Will the berry production still be possible without pollinators? Anton Milyaev Many plant species rely on pollinators, such as bees and other insects, that are essential for the fertilization of flowers. Scientists currently express their concerns that year after year there are less and less insects including bees due to the intensive insecticide use in agriculture. Does the yield of berry plants (raspberries, blueberries, currents, blackberries, etc.) also depend on pollinators? If yes, to what extent? Is berry production possible without pollinating insects? In this term paper, you will investigate how pollinator presence affects the pollination efficiency, fruit set, and overall yield of berry crops, and strategies to enhance pollination. 14.4 Agroforestry 9. The challenges of agroforestry modeling Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Modeling agroforestry systems are more complex than monocultures, so they have presented considerable challenges to the modeling community. This term paper outlines these challenges and reviews how they have been addressed in previous modeling attempts. 10. Barriers to agroforestry adoption in Germany (or elsewhere) Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Many experts agree that agroforestry systems can offer environmental, economic and social benefits to farmers. Yet adoption rates often remain low due to an array of barriers that keep farmers from integrating trees with other agricultural practices. This term paper reviews these barriers and proposed ideas for overcoming them. 11. Agroforestry in Germany (or elsewhere) - present distribution expansion potential Eike Luedeling, Marcos Jimenez Martinez Agroforestry has gained traction in many places, yet its spread in Germany (and many other countries) has been slow. This term paper reviews what types of systems exist and where they can be found (possibly using case studies). It also speculates on the potential distribution within this geographic region. 14.5 Global horticulture for SDGs 12. The contribution of horticulture to the Sustainable Development Goals with a specific focus on SDG 2 Cory Whitney In this term paper you will look into the various contributions horticultural production, processing and consumption make towards achieving the SDGs. You will also take a critical look into possible detrimental developments. 13. The Sustainable Development Goals and German policy on agroforestry Prajna Kasargodu Anebagilu In this term paper you will look into the implications of SDG relevant German policy and how it relates to horticulture, in particular agroforestry production systems. 14.6 From Greenhouse Production to Plant Factories 14. Can plant factories safe the world? Thorsten Kraska In this term paper you should evaluate which crops are already produced in plant factories (here used as a general term for all indoor farms, vertical farms, or controlled environment farms) and which crops are challenging. For crops already produced in plant factories compare yields and / or energy consumption to conventional farming systems. For crops not produced so far, discuss the challenging factors within a plant factory and how they could be solved. 15. For heaven`s sake use LED - the challenges in lighting Thorsten Kraska One main advantage of greenhouse production is control of environmental conditions. Lighting is not only responsible for plant growth and performance yielding in an horticultural produce. Lighting can also control the quality of produce, it could support plant growth depending on growth stage. So the challenge is, what is the optimal lighting? This term paper should focus on LED lighting. How could we control plant performance and quality by light? 16. It’s all about energy - how photovoltaic can be used for greenhouses and plant factories Thorsten Kraska Greenhouse production and plant factories depend on energy for light and heating. In this term paper it should be discussed which role photovoltaic will have for a more sustainable plant production. Would this makes a year-round production possible? Discover possible new trends how photovoltaic could be used in the future. 14.7 From Urban Horticulture to Social Gardening 17. Back to the roots… Thorsten Kraska It seems that horticulture is coming back to the roots, closer to the consumer, and often back into the cities. New forms of horticultural production have been and will be developed in an urban context (e.g community gardens, rooftop greenhouses and more). In this term paper these developments will be reviewed on basis of literature. How will horticultural production in cities look like in the future? What trends can be seen right now and what is the role of horticultural sciences and practice here? (This topic is somewhat related to Vertical farming topic “… up to the skies”). 18. Urban horticulture and the society Thorsten Kraska In this term paper the meaning of urban horticulture for society should be discussed. New forms of horticulture raises societal questions. Different topics are possible: (1) Is urban horticulture a common good? (2) Edible landscaping. (3) Urban horticulture and recreation. (4) Bring in your own topic. The aim of this term paper is to think out of the box of “production” to explore the meaning of horticulture for humans and society. 14.8 New plants for a future-competent horticultural production 19. Vegetable production in Germany in the context of the current energy crisis Jan Ellenberger Vegetable production - especially year-round production under glass - is extremely energy-intensive and in many parts still based on fossil fuels. What does the current energy crisis mean for domestic vegetable production? What are the farms doing, what is the political support and what prices can we expect for locally produced vegetables? 20. Vegetables in complex production systems Jan Ellenberger The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the integration of vegetables into complex production systems. In a global context, it becomes clear that growing similar vegetables on large areas is not the only possible form of production. Can more complex cropping systems also be successful in Germany? Do they even already exist? 14.9 Safeguarding Plant Health in Horticulture 21. How to protect plants in future? Thorsten Kraska Climate change will cause dramatic changes in horticulture. Horticultural production will move more and more to protected cultivation (e.g. tunnels, greenhouses). With that change in production new challenges in diesease management will arise. How we could protect our plants in future against climate change, weather extremes (e.g. drought) and new threats caused by insects or pathogens? In this term paper it should be analysed how climate change forced developments in horticulture (protected cultivation) and how this will affect disease management. 22. Biostimulants and Biorationals as new and emerging tools in plant health Thorsten Kraska Biostimulants and biorationals are “new” ways to strengthen plants to improve growth and tolerance against environmental stress (biostimulants) or to protect plants in an environmental friendly way against pest and diseases to replace synthetic chemicals. In this term paper the different approaches will be discussed. What are the differences between biostimulants and biorationals? How could they be used effectively to strengthen plant health? A critical review of literature based on examples like humic acid (as biostimulant) or drying linseed oil (as biorational). 14.10 Climate change and horticulture Please contact me if you’re interested in any of these, and I’ll give you details 23.
