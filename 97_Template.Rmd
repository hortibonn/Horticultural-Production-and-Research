* Materials

This section should contain (links to) materials on the assigned topics, accompanied by questions that the students should answer (and submit) before the session.

* Instructions

Instructions and information for the 90-minute participatory session. The session can contain some 'impulse lectures', but there should usually be a part where students do something active.

* Literature for discussion

One (or possibly two) articles on the topic, plus possibly some guiding questions (facilitating students can also develop their own questions). These should allow students to lead a 1-hour discussion on them.

* Term paper topics

One or two topics that students can write a term paper of 6-10 pages about.
