# ![Horticultural Production Systems](HPS_logo.png){width=90%} {-#header}

**Welcome to Horticultural Production and Research**

This is a module offered to students of the MSc programs of [Crop Science](https://www.lf.uni-bonn.de/en/studying/master/npw) and [Agricultural Sciences and Resource Management in the Tropics and Subtropics (ARTS)](https://www.arts.uni-bonn.de/) at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/the-university?set_language=en).

This course is brought to you be [Eike Luedeling](http://www.eikeluedeling.com/index.html), Professor of [Horticultural Sciences](https://www.gartenbauwissenschaft.uni-bonn.de/collage-startseite-pln-en?set_language=en) in the [Institute of Crop Science and Resource Conservation (INRES)](https://www.inres.uni-bonn.de/collage-startseite-1-en?set_language=en). He was supported by a strong team, including Erica Fadón, Christa Lankes, Thorsten Kraska, Marius Rütt, Simone Röhlen-Schmittgen, Shyam Pariyar and Nazim Gruda.

# Introduction {-#intro}

The materials assembled on this website support the lecture on **Horticultural Production and Research** in the Winter Semester of 2020/21. We're getting a new curriculum this semester, and this is the first time this module is being taught. For this time, the materials are largely identical to those of the lecture **Horticultural Production Systems** from the Summer Semester of 2020 (last semester). Since we basically covered the same content just a few months ago, we aren't sure how much interest this module will generate, so we concentrated on revamping some other modules that we offer for the first time this semester, or to a larger audience. 
What we have improved already is the interface (this website), which should make it easy to find all content you're looking for.

You can see a list of the topics we're covering in the navigation bar on the left.

You'll find more information on logistics here, as the semester begins (and we know whether we have any customers).

Enjoy!


<!--chapter:end:01_intro.Rmd-->

# Scientific writing  {-#sciWrite}
*by Eike Lüdeling, Katja Schiffers, Thorsten Kraska, Cory Whitney*

In this module, we will guide you through the composition of a scientific manuscript. This involved a range of materials, which we will make available in a range of different formats. The following is a road map through the materials. Note that not all materials are ready at this point. We’ll update this document whenever new content becomes available.

This chapter guides you through the content.

## Scientific writing – the basics
*By Eike Lüdeling*

We will start our instructions with a basic overview on how to compose a scientific manuscript: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/tkD6ihqn3QCFoTd

Part of this lecture was inspired by Angel Borja, a Spanish marine ecologist and experienced author and editor. His original materials are here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/OiPjlADtuUahZ40

The pdf version of the lecture slides is here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/IDfayVPIy2ia6BF


## Literature research
*By Thorsten Kraska*

This material was brought to you live via Zoom. We did not manage to record this, but we can at least provide you with the pdf slides here:
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/HckXakcYVB5UqgC



## Citing
*By Eike Lüdeling*

Citing sources is absolutely critical in scientific writing, and you need to know how this is done properly. The following materials provide an overview.

Here’s a recorded lecture on citing: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/O0QQqLUfmeCCpBl
And here are the pdf slides of the lecture: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/McjECrPFgpgOLlg

After you watched this lecture, you’ll (hopefully) want to learn how to use reference manager software. The following video presents a very brief introduction into how this works: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/7Ngd2fqkqgZVenC

You’ll also notice that for most, if not all, reference manager programs, you can find detailed information on the internet. So I trust you’ll be able to make use of these valuable tools.


## Statistical analysis with R
*By Katja Schiffers*

Now comes the most exiting part: with the analysis of your data you can answer the question you asked, gain new knowledge and push forward your field of science!

Here’s a recorded introduction to the statistical analysis of data with R (with a bit of a hiccup at the beginning of the slides, sorry): 
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tIAPEaw_FHc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

And here are the pdf slides of the lecture: 
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/vv2jQY7gVZyvu9q

We have also added two small data sets and an R script you can test and play with:
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/aMpgVBlUXd9Xw1N

And finally an R cheat cheet:

## Peer review
*By Cory Whitney*

Curious about Peer review? Here are some slides on what we expect from you in this course as well as some tips to prepare you for your career as a scientist:

- Stafford Noble 2017: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005730

All other links should be live in the lecture but feel free to get in touch if you need help finding something.


## Publishing
*By Eike Luedeling*

After we’re done with writing our scientific manuscript, we should consider publishing our findings in an academic journal. As I already hinted at, one group from the “class of 2019” managed (with a little help from their tutors) to publish their results and get the first entry for their publication lists: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/1/142

Especially for those of you targeting a scientific career, understanding how the publishing process works will be quite critical, and also for all others it is worth knowing how all this works. So I’ve recorded a little video that summarizes some of my experiences with the publishing process. It’ll also give you a heads-up about certain questionable practices in science that can be really damaging to a scientific career. Some people out there prey on young, inexperienced scientists, and you should be aware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows of academia.

and here’s the pdf: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/QYFIDUtcUt2tKvJ

And here are two ‘interesting’ papers I refer to in the lecture:

- [The deal with birds](https://irispublishers.com/sjrr/pdf/SJRR.MS.ID.000540.pdf)
- [Get me off your f*** mailing list](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/35a5/351e523c05258185d8ddade2b5e0b2e9d1da.pdf?_ga=2.53049128.101140378.1591447206-980524858.1587129762) and the [story about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Journal_of_Advanced_Computer_Technology)

Here’s [Beall’s list of predatory journals](https://beallslist.net/)


## Addressing peer-reviewer comments
*By Eike Luedeling*

I just came across a thread on Twitter by Michael Breakspear, an Australian professor of neuroscience, who summarized his approach to addressing reviewer comments. I don’t have much to add to this, so here’s his advice:
https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1273842646377566214.html

We try to follow a similar approach in our group, usually with pretty good results.

I want to highlight only one issue here, which many authors get wrong:

The review process is not just an annoying exam or a hurdle you somehow have to get across. It’s an opportunity to make your work better, and this is exactly what most reviewers are trying to help you with. These are your peers (in many cases much more experienced peers though, possibly with much busier schedules), who have put time and effort into providing you with constructive feedback. Take this feedback seriously, try to see the merits in what reviewers suggest and try to implement their suggestions. They usually truly make your paper better! Object only where these suggestions are clearly misguided or unrealistic, but then explain clearly and respectfully why this is the case. No reviewer appreciates, if her advice is dismissed, or if authors try to find the least inconvenient way of addressing suggestions!


Here’s an example of a recent revision we submitted (and got accepted by Climatic Change this morning, 23rd June 2020):
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/BQdMD1xrusEeFqY

Note in particular the ‘response to reviewers’ letter, starting on page 9, which contains all the comments we received, plus our responses (in a different color). You can also take a look at the supplementary materials. To see these, click on the link on the last page of this document.


## Giving oral presentations
*By Cory Whitney*

We are looking forward to your 15-minute talks on the 7th and 14th of July. 

Here’s some guidance on how to give an effective presentation: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/2NrfBdcADZwytJo

# Climate change and phenology modelling in horticulture
*by Eike Lüdeling*

In this lecture, you'll be introduced to one of the main lines of research we're working on in my group.
You'll (hopefully) learn

- what climate change is
- how we can project the impacts of climate change
- what phenology is
- how climate change and phenology are related
- what tree dormancy is
- what winter chill is
- how we can model winter chill
- how we can statistically evaluate tree phenology observations

# Strawberries and cane fruits
*by Christa Lankes*

Dear students,

For the topic "strawberries and cane fruits" I will provide you with the slides of my lecture and a corresponding text paper which is supposed to replace my talk. I split that up into 3 parts you will find when using the links below.
At the end of the slides’ files I add a list of questions for your self-studies. Please, write down a few lines on each of them for further purposes. I still do hope that later in term we will find an oppotunity to meet face-to-face for discussions on these questions. If not so, we will find a way to communicate online via ecampus. Therefore, please, watch the news provided this way.

Have fun with our online offers.


The lecture materials are split into two parts.

- For part one on strawberries, the slides are here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/AZXr61ZG2G7ag6m and the accompanying text is here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/vq8LHQbqQKUCr8b
- For part two on strawberries, the slides are here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/tXFhz9hF13sRHOw and the accompanying text is here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/iYx9RBxfxTTMWgT

# Plant health management
*by Shyam Pariyar*

Managing plant health is crucial for successful horticultural production. Here, Shyam Pariyar shares his insights into this important topic:
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/DNrDLBM47WwgB7Z , 

here are the slides as a pdf: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/6adLAPMbqKWQnJu

and 
here are some of the most relevant selected references to this lecture: 
https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/cpeSkxyrzva9Mun

Lecture contents: 
In this lecture, I would like to share some scientific information on a very important sector of horticultural production system (HPS), i.e. plant health management. These include highlighting some of the major plant protection approaches and a critical issues of HPS, namely copper use in integrated pest management (IPM) and Organic farming. More specifically, I would provide some in-depth scientific information on following topics: 

1) plant health interactions,  

2) plant health management approaches and 

3) copper use in horticulture. 

My main objectives of this lecture are to provide you: 

1) an overview on the impacts of some fungal pathogens on some selected tree fruit, staple or cash crop, vegetable crop and grapes,   

2) an overview an actual knowledge on plant health management approaches and researches used or potentially can be used in HPS, and 

3) in-depth knowledge about a critical issue of HPS, namely copper use in HPS from an ecological perspective. 

Last, but not least, your interest on listening this lecture would certainly add a value on the “International year of Plant Health 2020” declared by UN and FAO. If you have questions, please let me know during virtual Q&A session, in Slack or drop an email at (spariyar@uni-bonn.de). Cheers

## Virtual Field Trip

You’ve now learned enough to fully appreciate yet another highlight of this lecture series: The field trip!

Normally, you’d now be getting rained on or suburnt, or you’d be suffering from whatever other weather we’d have been dealt on the day of the field trip. You’d also be in for a couple of boring bus rides, dusty or muddy shoes and all the other trimmings usually associated with a trip to the countryside.

But not this time around! Instead, you have the extraordinary privilege to enjoy the first ever output of HortiWood Motion Pictures – our soon-to-be-a-classic movie on “Spargelanbau”.

So let’s follow our talented and inquisitive on-site reporting team to the asparagus farm of Matthias Engels in Bornheim. Listen to the probing questions by Tim Boenigk and the captivating narration by Priska Krefting, and enjoy your their first-hand eye-witness account of how one of Germany’s signature vegetables is produced.

Sit back and relax and enjoy your field trip into the world of “Spargelanbau”: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/xZbsw0X63TtXMV5
